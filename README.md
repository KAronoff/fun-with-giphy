##App Description
Fun With Giphy is allows the user to input a search field and desired result ammount.
##How To Use
1. Enter search term
2. Enter desired number of results (1-25)
3. Press *search gif*
4. To play/pause the gif, click on the gif.
5. The search will produce gifs related to the search term, and the number entered. This will also produce a button on the bottom of the 3 standing buttons, that can be clicked on at a later point to generate more images of that type.
6. To clear the buttons (except for the original 3) and the gif area, press *Clear Buttons*

###Features
On load the app creates 3 buttons: Kim Possible, Pusheen, and Grumpy Cat.At start, each of those buttons (if clicked) will produce 10 results by default.

Each button has both a search term and a number associated to it. The number says how many results will be returned. 

To change the results number on an existing button (either one of the original 3 or a new one added later), enter a number in the *number of results* field, then press the topic. For example, to change Kim Possible from *Kim Possible - 10* to *Kim Possible -20*, insert the number *20* in the field, and then press *Kim Possible*. The number attached to the button will change and it will remember the last number of search results. This prevents needing to create multiple buttons with the same search criteria.

There is a loading text that appears while loading the page.

There is also mobile compatability.

##Future Updates
Future updates would include the ability to save search results to local storage, so the page would remember results upon returning.
